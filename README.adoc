Alaris is a new and sneaky shellcode loader capable of bypassing most EDR systems as of today (02/28/2021). It uses several known TTP's that help protect the malware and it's execution flow. Some of these features are:

* Shellcode Encryption (AES-CBC 256)
* Direct x86 Syscalls via https://twitter.com/Jackson_T[@Jackson T's] new https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers2[SyWhispers2]
* Prevents 3rd party (non-Microsoft Signed) DLL's from hooking or injecting both the parent and child processes. 
* Parent Process ID spoofing
* Overwrites it's own shellcode after execution.

=== Updates

As on February 28th, 2021, several changes have been made:

. You can now easily build Alaris with the Python3 `builder.py` tool.
. Moved from https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers[SysWhispers] to https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers2[SysWhispers2]
. Key and IV are now dynamic for each build via PBKDF2

== Building Alaris

The easiest method to build Alaris is with `builder.py`. I assume the following when you're building a new Alaris loader:

. You are compiling on a Windows host. Preferably, Windows 10.
. You have Visual Studio 2019+ [Community, Professional] installed with C++ (https://github.com/cribdragg3r/Alaris/issues/2#issuecomment-749069975[See example here])
. You have Python3 installed and have `pip install -r requirements.txt`


[source, python]
